## OpenElections Metadata

This repository contains metadata about elections in states, as described in the [documentation](http://docs.openelections.net/election-metadata/). The information is available in two forms: a [sqlite database](https://github.com/openelections/openelections-metadata/blob/master/openelections.db) and JSON files contained in state-specific folders.
